  description:
    "Boardzilla is an online application that serves as a dashboard for a variety of \
    information meant to serve as a daily briefing or hub.  Each user has their own protected \
    account with a customizable/reconfigurable dashboard screen containing the widgets of their choice.  The users \
    are able to select their desired quantities of a weather widget, a sticky notes widget, a calendar \
    widget, a stock widget and a news widget.  Widgets can be added or removed and can be repositioned \
    on the usersâ€™ dashboards.  In addition, users will be able to input data into each widget \
    and modify options unique to each widget.\
    This application was created with the MERN stack and express-session authentication was implemented\
    with Passport.js. On the front-end, I used React with Redux to create a responsive and attractive user interface.",
