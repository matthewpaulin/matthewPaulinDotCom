{"pageProps":{"project":{"title":"Boardzilla","id":"boardzilla","date":"2021","url":"https://boardzilla.matthewpaulin.com","github":"https://github.com/matthewpaulin/Boardzilla","description":"Boardzilla is an online application that serves as a dashboard for a variety of     information meant to serve as a daily briefing or hub.  Each user has their own protected     account with a customizable/reconfigurable dashboard screen containing the widgets of their choice.  The users     are able to select their desired quantities of a weather widget, a sticky notes widget, a calendar     widget, a stock widget and a news widget.  Widgets can be added or removed and can be repositioned     on the users’ dashboards.  In addition, users will be able to input data into each widget     and modify options unique to each widget.    This application was created with the MERN stack and express-session authentication was implemented    with Passport.js. On the front-end, I used React with Redux to create a responsive and attractive user interface.","subtitle":"Boardzilla is an online app to create personalized dashboards with a variety of customizable widgets.
