Each user has their own protected     account with a customizable/reconfigurable dashboard screen containing the widgets of their choice.  The users     are able to select their desired quantities of a weather widget, a sticky notes widget, a calendar     widget, a stock widget and a news widget.  Widgets can be added or removed and can be repositioned     on the usersâ€™ dashboards.  In addition, users will be able to input data into each widget     and modify options unique to each widget.    This application was created with the MERN stack and express-session authentication was implemented    with Passport.js. On the front-end, I used React with Redux to create a responsive and attractive user interface.","subtitle":"Boardzilla is an app to create personalized dashboards constructed with a variety of customizable widgets.","slug":"boardzilla","images":[],"preview":{"url":"https://i.ibb.co/ByDrHVL/logo.png","alternativeText":"boardzilla logo"},"categories":["MongoDB","Express.js","React","Redux","Node.js"]},{"title":"Easy Money","id":"easymoney","date":"2020","url":"em.matthewpaulin.com","github":"https://github.com/matthewpaulin/Easy-Money","description":"I created Easy Money mainly as a means to introduce myself to React as well as Google Firebase.     The inspiration to make the app came from checking my bank statements and being less than thrilled with what     I was spending on dining, fashion, and entertainment. I often find that when I write my expenses down, I seem     to be more conscientious of my purchases, and as a result, my spending tends to be more conservative. Therefore     with this application, my main goal was to have a single place to track purchases across several accounts.     This was achieved using a React front-end and connecting it to Google Firebase for storage and authentication.     As an additional feature I added a budgeting feature to create plans for my spending and hopefully stick to them.","subtitle":"A responsive budgeting and expense tracking web application with authentication.","slug":"easymoney","images":[],"preview":{"url":"https://i.ibb.co/9t4PFXW/easymoney.png","alternativeText":"Easy Money Logo"},"categories":["React","Firebase"]},{"title":"Whiteboards","id":"whiteboards","date":"2020","url":"whiteboard.matthewpaulin.com","github":"https://github.com/TOHacks-Dev/whiteboard","description":"I made Whiteboards with some friends for TOHacks 2020 during the Covid-19 lockdown.     The pandemic made us want a convenient place to collaboratively sketch pictures for fun, work through     math problems, and more. From this idea, we created an online whiteboard that includes several drawing     tools and can be viewed and edited by many people simultaneously. To enable collaboration, we leveraged     Google Firebase's Cloud Firestore and connected it to an HTML canvas. Some drawing tools include shape     and text insertion, multiple brushes, picture uploading, erasing, and others. I had a lot of fun creating     this project and the best part was that it was completed in a weekend, no procrastination required.","subtitle":"A collaborative online whiteboard with drawing, shape creation, image uploading and more.","slug":"whiteboards","images":[],"preview":{"url":"https://i.ibb.co/483jPnd/whiteboards.png","alternativeText":"Whiteboards Logo"},"categories":["Canvas API","Firebase"]},{"title":"1943","id":"1943","date":"2017","url":"","github":"https://github.com/matthewpaulin/1943","subtitle":"My humble recreation of the classic 2D plane shoot 'em up arcade game, created with Pygame.","slug":"1943","images":[],"preview":{"url":"https://i.ibb.co/TR3xNt8/1943.jpg","alternativeText":"1943 cover art"},"categories":["Python","Pygame"]},{"title":"Tetris","id":"tetris","date":"2017","url":"","github":"https://github.com/matthewpaulin/Tetris","subtitle":"Spawned from my love of classic Tetris, this game adds some extra features to the original.","slug":"tetris","images":[],"preview":{"url":"https://i.ibb.co/yg6CQyP/tetris.jpg","alternativeText":"Falling tetrominos"},"categories":["Python","Pygame"]},{"title":"Snake","id":"snake","date":"2017","url":"","github":"https://github.com/matthewpaulin/Snake","subtitle":"This game was my introduction to the Python library Pygame.
