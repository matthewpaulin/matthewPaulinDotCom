The inspiration to make the app came from checking my bank statements and being less than thrilled with what     I was spending on dining, fashion, and entertainment. I often find that when I write my expenses down, I seem     to be more conscientious of my purchases, and as a result, my spending tends to be more conservative. Therefore     with this application, my main goal was to have a single place to track purchases across several accounts.     This was achieved using a React front-end and connecting it to Google Firebase for storage and authentication.     As an additional feature I added a budgeting feature to create plans for my spending and hopefully stick to them.","subtitle":"A responsive budgeting and expense tracking web application with authentication.","slug":"easymoney","images":[],"preview":{"url":"https://i.ibb.co/9t4PFXW/easymoney.png","alternativeText":"Easy Money Logo"},"categories":["React","Firebase"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
