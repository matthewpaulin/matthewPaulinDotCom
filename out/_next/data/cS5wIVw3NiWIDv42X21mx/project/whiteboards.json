{"pageProps":{"project":{"title":"Whiteboards","id":"whiteboards","date":"2020","url":"whiteboard.matthewpaulin.com","github":"https://github.com/TOHacks-Dev/whiteboard","description":"I made Whiteboards with some friends for TOHacks 2020 during the Covid-19 lockdown.     The pandemic made us want a convenient place to collaboratively sketch pictures for fun, work through     math problems, and more. From this idea, we created an online whiteboard that includes several drawing     tools and can be viewed and edited by many people simultaneously. To enable collaboration, we leveraged     Google Firebase's Cloud Firestore and connected it to an HTML canvas. Some drawing tools include shape     and text insertion, multiple brushes, picture uploading, erasing, and others. I had a lot of fun creating     this project and the best part was that it was completed in a weekend, no procrastination required.","subtitle":"A collaborative online whiteboard with drawing, shape creation, image uploading and more.","slug":"whiteboards","images":[],"preview":{"url":"https://i.ibb.co/483jPnd/whiteboards.png","alternativeText":"Whiteboards Logo"},"categories":["Canvas API","Firebase"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
