  intro:
    "Hi there, I'm Matthew, a fourth-year Software Engineering student studying at McMaster University. \
      My goal is to create software that has a positive and demonstrable impact on people's lives. Right now my main area of focus \
      is full stack web development and I enjoy making side projects in my free time. When I'm not programming, I like to watch movies \
      and television, go bouldering, or read fantasy novels.",
